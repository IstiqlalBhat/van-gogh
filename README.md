# Hey! You found my digital canvas 🎨

So, you're looking at the code behind this thing. I'm honestly glad you're here.

You know how sometimes you look at a loading screen and just kind of... zone out? Like, your brain goes on standby mode while a little circle spins around forever. I really, *really* wanted to avoid that feeling.

I wanted to make something that felt alive. Even the waiting part.

That's basically what this project is. It's my portfolio, sure (I'm Istiqlal, by the way!), but it's also a bit of an experiment. I'm trying to mash up the raw emotion of Van Gogh's art with the precision of code. It's a weird mix, I know. But when you see that "hallucination" effect kick in on the loader... it just feels right.

### What's actually under the hood?

I didn't want to overcomplicate things with a million massive frameworks. It's just:

*   **HTML & CSS** (The bones and the makeup)
*   **Three.js** (The magic sauce that makes the images wave and breathe)
*   **A bit of GLSL** (Okay, this is the scary math part, but it's what creates that trippy distortion effect)

It's pretty lightweight. I kept it that way so I could focus on the visuals without fighting a build tool every five minutes. We've all been there, right?

### Want to run it?

It's super simple. Since there's no complex backend, you just need to serve the files.

If you've got Python installed (and who doesn't these days?), just pop open your terminal in this folder and type:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

Then head over to `localhost:8000` in your browser.

### A quick side note...

If the animations feel a bit *too* liquidy or the colors look weird, that's actually intentional! I'm trying to capture that feeling of losing your mind a little bit... in a good, artistic way. Like Van Gogh said, I put my heart and soul into this.

Anyway, take a look around. Break things. Fix them. And if you see something that makes you smile, then I've done my job.

Cheers! ☕
